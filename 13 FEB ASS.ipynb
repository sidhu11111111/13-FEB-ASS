    " When creating a custom exception in Python, it is essential to inherit from the built-in Exception class. This is because Exception is the base class for all exceptions in Python, and it provides the necessary functionality for handling exceptions. By inheriting from the Exception class, the custom exception can utilize the properties and methods of the base class, such as the message and traceback information."

    "\n",
    "Be specific: Catch only the exceptions that you expect to be raised and handle them appropriately. Avoid using bare except clauses, as they can catch unexpected exceptions and mask errors.\n",

    "Provide useful error messages: Include descriptive error messages in your exceptions that explain what went wrong and how to fix it. This information can help users diagnose and fix the problem.\n",
    "Log exceptions: Use a logging library to record exceptions that occur during runtime. This can help you debug issues and improve the stability of your code.\n",
    "Use context managers: Use the with statement and context managers to handle resources like files, sockets, and database connections. This can help ensure that resources are properly cleaned up, even in the event of an exception."
